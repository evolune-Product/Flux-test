## 🚀 What is Evo-TFX?

Evo-TFX is an **all-in-one API testing platform** that uses AI to automatically generate and execute comprehensive test suites. Built for modern development teams who want to test smarter and ship faster.

## 🎯 Core Features

### 1. **AI-Powered Test Generation**
- Automatically generates test cases based on your API structure
- Reduces manual test writing by **90%**
- Creates Happy Path, Edge Cases, Negative Tests, and Security Tests

### 2. **Four Testing Types in One Platform**

#### 🧪 Functional Testing
- Comprehensive API validation
- CRUD operation testing
- Data validation and response checking
- Custom test case creation

#### ⚡ Smoke Testing
- Quick health checks for critical endpoints
- Perfect for CI/CD pipelines
- Fast deployment validation

#### 📊 Performance Testing
- Load testing (sustained traffic)
- Stress testing (breaking points)
- Spike testing (sudden traffic bursts)
- Endurance testing (long-duration stability)
- Real-time metrics and analytics

#### 💥 Chaos Engineering
- Network latency injection
- Service failure simulation
- Timeout scenarios
- Rate limiting tests
- System resilience validation

## 🔥 Why Choose Evo-TFX?

### **vs Traditional Tools (Postman, Katalon, JMeter)**

| Feature | Evo-TFX | Traditional Tools |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| AI Test Generation | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Manual |
