[0:00 - 0:20] OPENING HOOK - THE PROBLEM IS REAL
================================================================================

[Show logo, then transition to split-screen: stressed developer vs broken production system]

"Picture this: It's 3 AM. Your production API just crashed. Users can't checkout.
You're losing $10,000 per hour. The root cause? A single untested edge case that
slipped through your $20,000 testing setup.

This isn't hypothetical. This happens every day to development teams worldwide.

Hi, I'm [Your Name], founder of Evo-TFX, and we've built the world's first
AI-powered unified API testing platform that would have prevented this.

Here's the hard truth about API testing today..."


[0:20 - 0:55] THE $40 BILLION PROBLEM
================================================================================

[Show slides: multiple tools, manual work, production failures]

"Development teams are drowning in complexity:

**FIRST**, manual testing consumes 40-60% of development time. Engineers spend
weeks writing test cases instead of building features.

**SECOND**, companies are forced to juggle 6-8 different expensive tools:
- Postman for functional testing - $500 per user
- JMeter for performance - complex setup
- Custom security scripts - requires experts
- Separate chaos engineering tools - $1,000+ annually
- Contract testing frameworks - steep learning curves
- GraphQL-specific tools - limited capabilities
Total annual cost: $5,000 to $20,000 per team. Setup time: weeks or months.

**THIRD**, even with all these tools, 60% of bugs still reach production because
manual testing can't cover every edge case, security vulnerability, or performance
scenario.

The result? Slow releases, expensive tool sprawl, and critical failures costing
businesses millions annually.

This is a $40 billion global market crying for disruption."


[0:55 - 2:00] OUR SOLUTION - 8 TESTING TYPES + ADVANCED AI
================================================================================

[Show Evo-TFX dashboard with testing modules + AI analysis panel]

"Evo-TFX solves this with the world's first UNIFIED AI-POWERED testing platform
featuring 8 comprehensive testing types and advanced AI intelligence:

**THE 8 TESTING TYPES:**

**1. Functional API Testing** - Our AI engine automatically generates 50-100 test
cases for REST APIs in seconds. Happy paths, edge cases, negative tests, and
security validation. What takes teams days, we do in minutes.

**2. Smoke Testing** - Ultra-fast health checks under 5 minutes. Perfect deployment
gates for CI/CD pipelines. Go/no-go decisions in real-time.

**3. Performance Testing** - Complete load, stress, spike, and endurance testing
with 100-1000 concurrent users. Identify bottlenecks before they hit production.

**4. Chaos Engineering** - Inject timeouts, network failures, 500/503 errors.
Validate resilience under real-world failure scenarios. Netflix-style chaos testing
for everyone.

**5. Fuzz Testing** - Advanced security with 30+ attack vectors. Automatically
detects buffer overflows, SQL injection, XSS, and memory corruption vulnerabilities.
This is enterprise-grade security testing.

**6. Regression Testing** - Automatic baseline comparison and change detection.
Track API evolution over time and prevent breaking changes with historical tracking.

**7. Contract Testing** - Consumer-driven contracts for microservices. Verify API
contracts, prevent breaking changes, ensure service compatibility across your
architecture.

**8. GraphQL Testing** - AI-powered with automatic schema introspection, intelligent
query generation, N+1 detection, and deep nested query analysis.

But here's what makes us truly revolutionary - our ADVANCED AI CAPABILITIES..."


[2:00 - 2:45] THE AI BREAKTHROUGH - WHAT WE'VE ACTUALLY BUILT
================================================================================

[Show AI Analysis Panel + real analysis results]

"Most tools claim AI but just do basic automation. We've built REAL AI intelligence
powered by GPT-4:

**AI ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS** - When tests fail, our AI doesn't just tell you WHAT
failed - it tells you WHY, with CTO-level engineering insights:
- Identifies root causes, not just symptoms
- Provides severity scoring (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Delivers technical deep-dives and business impact analysis
- Gives actionable fix recommendations with estimated repair times
- Includes confidence scoring on every analysis
- Auto-triggers for critical failures, manual trigger for others

**INTELLIGENT COVERAGE ANALYSIS** - Our AI analyzes your test suite and automatically
identifies gaps:
- Detects missing test scenarios you haven't thought of
- Calculates coverage scores with gap analysis
- Prioritizes tests by criticality
- Suggests edge cases based on your API structure

**PREDICTIVE FAILURE ANALYSIS** - This is where it gets powerful:
- AI learns from your test history and predicts which tests will fail BEFORE you run them
- Identifies flaky tests automatically
- Warns about high-risk tests based on code changes
- Provides proactive maintenance recommendations

**BATCH PATTERN DETECTION** - When multiple tests fail:
- AI finds common patterns across failures
- Identifies systemic issues (database down, network problems, auth failures)
- Shows blast radius of failures
- Delivers unified fix strategies

**HISTORICAL LEARNING** - Our platform gets smarter over time:
- Stores every analysis in PostgreSQL
- Pattern matches against historical failures
- Learns from your team's testing behavior
- Improves recommendations with each use

This isn't theoretical. This is production-ready AI running on GPT-4 TODAY."


[2:45 - 3:15] LIVE DEMO / PLATFORM DEMONSTRATION
================================================================================

[Show actual platform with test execution + AI analysis]

"Let me show you how simple this is:

**STEP 1** - Enter your API endpoint. Takes 30 seconds.

**STEP 2** - Select your testing type. All 8 available in one interface.

**STEP 3** - Our AI generates comprehensive test cases. For functional testing,
50-100 tests covering all scenarios. For security, 30+ attack vectors. For GraphQL,
automatic schema discovery and query generation.

**STEP 4** - Click "Run Tests" and watch real-time execution with detailed logs.

**STEP 5** - When failures occur, AI AUTOMATICALLY analyzes critical issues and
provides this: [Show AI analysis panel]
- Root cause identified with 95% confidence
- Severity: Critical
- Technical details: "Authentication token expired. JWT validation failing."
- Business impact: "Users cannot access protected resources. Revenue impact: High"
- Recommendations: "1. Implement token refresh logic 2. Add token expiration monitoring"
- Estimated fix time: 30-45 minutes

**STEP 6** - Export to JSON/PDF or push directly to GitHub for CI/CD integration.

Setup time? 5 minutes. Traditional tools? Weeks.

We support Bearer tokens, API keys, Basic Auth - everything you need to test
production APIs securely.

This is the future of API testing, and it's available RIGHT NOW."
